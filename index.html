    <p> Zurich Trip</p>

    <li> <b>Schweizerisches Landesmuseum (Swiss National Museum) </b></li>
    <p></p> A castle-like building with neo-Gothic flourishes houses an excellent museum showcasing the cultural history of all
    Switzerland. It is by far the most important collection of Swiss historic and cultural artifacts - more than 820,000 of
    them, covering a wide range of subjects from prehistory through the 20th century. The archaeological collections, with
    artifacts discovered in Switzerland that date from about 100,000 BC to about AD 800 are among the finest in Europe.
    Entire collections cover works of gold- and silversmiths, textiles, costumes, metalwork, jewelry, watches and clocks,
    scientific instruments, rural life, carriages and sleighs, musical instruments, crafts, and industrial antiquities. The
    medieval wall paintings are particularly interesting, as is the collection of old stained glass. The Armory Tower
    exhibits an important collection of arms and armor.

    <li> <b> <font>Grossmünster (Great Minster)</b> </li></font>
    Standing in an open terrace above the river, Zürich's principal church dominates the city skyline with its twin towers.
    Built between the 11th and the 13th centuries, it is a Romanesque three-aisled galleried basilica with a chancel over a
    crypt that dates from about 1100. The upper levels of the towers date from 1487, but the domed tops were added in 1782.

            <li> <b>Zurich Zoo </b> </li>

More than 360 different animal species live in the exotic world of the Zurich Zoo, one of the finest in Europe. Animals
live as close to their own environments as possible: snow leopards amid the rocky Himalayan landscape, penguins swimming
in chilly water, and you can spot flying foxes from a canopy walk amid 13,000 square meters of tropical rainforest.
